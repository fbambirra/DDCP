Bayesian inference for diffusion-driven Cox process

The algorithms are coded in Ox

Please, download Ox Console (including OxEdit) from the link https://www.doornik.com/download.html.
Ox is free for academic use.

For all the examples, there is a main file, named main_code.ox, which is the one to be run and that contains all the required specifications to be set.

The datasets used in the manuscript are saved in files named *.mat inside the respective folder of each example.
The first row of the data file contains its number of rows and columns (Ox format).

For each of the examples provide, there are a few specifications that can be modified by the user by following the comments in the code.

We are attaching the following three of the examples presented in the paper.


##### Coal mine disasters #####

Main file: mcmc.ox


##### S&P500 #####
